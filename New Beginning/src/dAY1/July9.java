//		11. Write a java program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, and number of years, and displays the future investment value using the following formula:
//			futureInvestmentValue=investmentAmount x(1+𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑙𝑦𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒)𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑂𝑓𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠∗12
//			For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.
//			Here is a sample run:
//			Enter investment amount: 1000.56
//			Enter annual interest rate in percentage: 4.25
//			Enter number of years: 1
//			Accumulated value is $1043.92
